        One with a decimal number (float)
        One with text (string)
        One that is either true or false (boolean)
    Print each variable along with its value.

## Day 4 Challenge: Basic Operators

Today, you'll work with basic operators to perform simple calculations.

Task:

        Upload your code to your GitHub repository.

## Day 7 Challenge: Loops (For Loop)

Today, you'll learn how to use a for loop to iterate over a sequence.

Task:

    Write a program that:
        Asks the user to enter a word.
        Uses a for loop to print each letter of the word on a new line.

## Day 8 Challenge: Basic Functions

Today, you'll learn how to create and use functions to make your code more modular and reusable.

Task:

    Write a program that:
        Defines a function called greet that takes a person's name as a parameter.
