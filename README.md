Simple Daily Day to Day Coding Challenges

## Day 3 Challenge: Variables and Data Types

Today's challenge is to learn how to use variables and different types of data.

Task:
    Create 4 variables:
        One with a whole number (integer)
        One with a decimal number (float)
        One with text (string)
        One that is either true or false (boolean)
    Print each variable along with its value.

Example (in Python):

age = 20  # Integer
height = 5.9  # Float
name = "John"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean

print(age)
print(height)
print(name)
print(is_student)

## Day 4 Challenge: Basic Operators

Today, you'll work with basic operators to perform simple calculations.

Task:

    Write a program that:
        Asks the user to enter two numbers.
        Performs the following operations on the numbers:
            Addition
            Subtraction
            Multiplication
            Division

Example (in Python):

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

add = num1 + num2
sub = num1 - num2
mul = num1 * num2
div = num1 / num2

print(f"The result of addition is: {add}")
print(f"The result of subtraction is: {sub}")
print(f"The result of multiplication is: {mul}")
print(f"The result of division is: {div}")

## Day 5 Challenge: Conditional Statements

Today, you'll learn how to make decisions in your program using conditional statements.

Task:

    Write a program that:
        Asks the user to enter their age.
        Uses an if-else statement to check the user's age:
            If the age is 18 or older, print: "You are an adult."
            If the age is below 18, print: "You are a minor."

## Day 6 Challenge: Loops (While Loop)

Today, you'll learn how to repeat actions using a while loop.

Task:
    Write a program that:
        Asks the user to enter a number.
        Uses a while loop to print all the numbers from 1 to the user's number.

Example (in Python):

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
i = 1

while i <= num:
    print(i)
    i += 1
